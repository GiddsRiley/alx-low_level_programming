##argc & argv##

In C programming, the "argc" and "argv" parameters are used in the declaration of the "main" function to allow a program to receive command-line arguments.

"argc" is an integer parameter that represents the number of command-line arguments passed to the program. It is always at least 1, since the first argument is always the name of the program itself.

"argv" is a pointer to an array of strings that contains the actual arguments passed to the program. Each string in the array represents one command-line argument, and the first element (argv[0]) is always the name of the program.

By using "argc" and "argv" in the "main" function, a program can be made to accept input parameters from the command line, allowing it to be more versatile and flexible.
