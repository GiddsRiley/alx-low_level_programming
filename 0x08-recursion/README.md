#RECURSION#


Recursion is a technique in computer programming where a function calls itself during its execution. In C programming, recursion is implemented by defining a function that calls itself with modified arguments until a base case is reached, at which point the function returns and the recursion stops.

A recursive function typically consists of two parts: the base case and the recursive case. The base case is the condition where the function stops calling itself and returns a value. The recursive case is the condition where the function calls itself with modified arguments.

Here is an example of a recursive function in C programming that calculates the factorial of a number:

arduino

int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
}

In this function, the base case is when n equals 0, and the function returns 1. The recursive case is when n is not 0, and the function calls itself with n - 1 as the argument.

Recursion can be a powerful technique for solving certain types of problems, but it can also be inefficient and can lead to stack overflow errors if the recursion depth becomes too large. Therefore, it is important to carefully design recursive functions and consider alternative approaches when recursion is not the best solution.
