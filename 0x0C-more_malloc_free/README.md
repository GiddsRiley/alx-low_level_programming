`MALOC`

`malloc` is a function in the C programming language used to dynamically allocate memory at runtime. It stands for "memory allocation". The malloc function takes a size argument as input and returns a pointer to a block of memory of the specified size that can be used by the program. The memory allocated by malloc is taken from the heap, which is a region of memory set aside for dynamic allocation during program execution.

`void *malloc(size_t size);`

The size parameter specifies the number of bytes to allocate. The return value is a pointer to the first byte of the allocated memory block. If the memory allocation fails, malloc returns a null pointer.

The malloc function is commonly used to allocate memory for arrays, structures, and other data structures in C. After the memory is allocated, it can be accessed using pointer arithmetic or array notation. However, it is important to remember to free the allocated memory when it is no longer needed to prevent memory leaks, which can cause the program to run out of memory over time.
